Developing the uDrone was truly a group effort. First and foremost I would like to thank my committee chair, Dr. Jnaneshwar Das, for allowing me to realize one of my lifelong dreams and work on an underwater vehicle. His support was vital through the entirety of this project.

Fellow members of the DREAMS Lab put in great effort to create the uDrone. A.L.G Prasad and Harish Anand were key contributors of code and simulation development. Cole Brauer, Rodney Staggers Jr, and Devin Keating were responsible for the terrific physical design and construction of the uDrone. Zhiang Chen and Sarah Bearman were amazing sounding boards for the uDrone vision and science applications.

Dr. Greg Asner, a committee chair, came up with the inspiration for the creation of the uDrone. His team at GDCS, particularly Jiwei Li and Nick Vaughn, provided much helpful background. 

Dr. Hamidreza Marvi, a committee chair, provided education and insight for the development of the mathematical model.

I would also like to thank all my teammates for class projects who often allowed us to work on tasks related to the uDrone. In particular, Evan Lamb and Jason Newton contributed to the optimal controls project that is featured chapter \ref{2d} of this thesis.

Finally, I would not be here today without the love and support of my wife, sisters, parents, and friends. Thank you all.
