Alex Goldman is a Master's of Science student in the Robotics and Autonomous Systems program with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at Arizona State University and a member of the Distributed Robotic Exploration and Mapping Systems Laboratory. Before attending ASU for his Master's, Alex started several entrepreneurial ventures and worked as a project lead on large projects involving both hardware and software. This led Alex to be an ideal candidate to take on the uDrone project, which leveraged his leadership experience while furthering his engineering education. Alex has had a lifelong interest in the aquatic environment and reef conservation. He started scuba diving at the age of 11 and at 19 he became a certified Scuba instructor. During his undergrad at the University of Michigan, he was one of the leaders of the Human Powered Submarine Team. After school, he volunteered as a scuba diver at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. He even proposed to his wife underwater. This is all to say: Alex has been personally interested in scuba diving and reef conservation for a very long time.
